# Hand Gesture Recognition  

## Overview  
This project implements a **Hand Gesture Recognition** system using **Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and TensorFlow**. It detects and classifies hand movements in real time, enabling gesture-based interactions.  

## Features  
- **Real-time Hand Tracking** using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe**  
- **Gesture Classification** with **TensorFlow-based ML models**  
- **Supports Multiple Gestures** for interaction  
- **Efficient and Lightweight** implementation  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV** (for image processing and hand tracking)  
- **MediaPipe** (for hand landmark detection)  
- **TensorFlow** (for training and classifying gestures)  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohammedarman54/Hand-Gesture-Recognition.git
   cd Hand-Gesture-Recognition
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

## Usage  
1. Run the gesture recognition script:  
   ```bash
   python gesture_recognition.py
   ```  
2. Move your hand in front of the webcam to detect gestures.  

## Future Enhancements  
- **Adding More Gesture Classes** for better interaction  
- **Integrating with Applications** (e.g., controlling media, games, or UI elements)  
- **Optimizing Model Performance** for faster and more accurate recognition
